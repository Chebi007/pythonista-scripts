# pythonista-scripts
Useful scripts to be run in Pythonista for iOS.  Kudos to [cclause](https://github.com/cclauss) for line by line code cleanup and helpful comments on improving these scripts.

- **Search IMDB.py** - A script that I find useful to quickly look up info on a movie title or a TV series.  The results of the query are displayed on the console screen and a Markdown version is copied to the clipboard for pasting to a text editor, etc.

- **PhotosToDropbox.py** - A script that lets you select multiple photos from the iPhone camera roll, resize & geo-tag them, and upload them to Dropbox where they are renamed and organized based on the date and time they were taken.  The cool part is that the script will preserve the metadata of the original photo if desired, using the Pexif module to read the metadata from the original and write it back to the resized copy.  The Pexif module can be imported into Pythonista by simply copying pexif.py into the Pythonista script directory. The Pexif module can be found [here](https://github.com/bennoleslie/pexif).

- **WeatherAnywhere.py** - This script was inspired by The script displays all it's information on the console screen, ideally suited for an iPhone in portrait orientation. The only graphics shown are weather icons illustrating the forecast, but lots of weather info is provided, including forecast, humidity, pressure, temperature, precipitation amounts, wind speed, and wind chill. The info is in imperial units, but could easily be changed to metric via a flag in the url. The script makes use of a csv file, 'cities.csv', to be located in the same folder as the script, and 11 png files that display weather types, also located in the script's directory. The csv file contains popular cities, including their country and ID in your area as well as other national and international cities as desired. The file is easily editable with the Pythonista editor. The conversion functions used here were taken from https://github.com/kultprok/pythonista-drafts/recipes/blob/master/weatherdata/weatherdata.py
